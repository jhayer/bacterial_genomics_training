# Antimicrobial Resistance Genes and Mutations detection

## Before we start

We will be using 2 different tools and their associated databases for detecting genes and mutations that could confer an antimicrobial resistance to the bacteria carrying it.
These tools are:

- [AMRFinderPlus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/antimicrobial-resistance/AMRFinder/) from NCBI

- [CARD](https://card.mcmaster.ca/home) [RGI](https://card.mcmaster.ca/analyze/rgi) (Resistance Gene Identifier)


## Practical

In this practical you will learn to run these tools and their associated tools, to inspect the output files, and to visualise them in a graphical way.

## Installing the tools


```
conda or container ??
databases ?
```
