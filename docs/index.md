# Welcome to the bioinformatics training for Bacterial Genomics and

You will find on the left menu several tutorials, from basics unix manipulations to more complex HTS data analyses.


# Thanks and contributors

The tutorials are developed by Juliette Hayer and Lokman Galal (Institut de Recherche pour le Développement)

Some of them are inspired from the teaching materials of Hadrien Gourlé ([https://github.com/HadrienG](https://github.com/HadrienG)). Thanks to him :-)
We created some of them together during our time at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU). Thanks to SLU, to the SLU Global bioinformatics Centre (SGBC) and to SLUBI ([SLU Bioinformatics Infrastructure](https://www.slubi.se/))
